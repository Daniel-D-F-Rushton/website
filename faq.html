        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Is lucid dreaming real?</button>
        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                Yes, and scientifically proven to be so.<br>
                Lucid dreaming among most people has a bad name for two different reasons.<br>
                <li>Most people have never experienced - or don't remember experiencing - a lucid dream, so they presume that it must not be real.</li>
                <li>Lucid dreaming is so often linked to pseudo-scientific things and thus people presume it to be fake by association</li>
                <br>
            </p>
            <p class="question">
                Let's address the never having experienced part. That is easily fixed. By just trying it yourself you will soon see the progression from I don't even think I dream, to oh yeah I can become lucid... if only for a second, to this is completely real! All it is going to cost you is a little effort.<br><br>
                Then we need to address the second part. This world is full of charlatans and one of the easiest ways to get money out of people is to piggyback a fairy-tale on something that is real. "Lucid dreaming is the first step to [enter something fake here]" The unfortunate thing is that all the tools you need to be able to lucid dream are known... and also on this site... therefore if you want to try and squeeze a few bucks out of someone, you are going to have to sell them something else. Enter the BS!

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can anyone lucid dream?</button>
        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                Yes! There are no barriers to entry.

        </div>
        <button type="button" class="collapsible">How often can you lucid dream?</button>
        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                That differs from person to person. There are people that say that they lucid dream all night long... and these people are full of it! The real answer is the theoretical limit is based on how much REM sleep you get, the actual amount depends on how much you manage to realise you are dreaming. This isn't an automatic thing and has to be trained.<br><br>
                From experience I will tell you that even if you become proficient at it, there will be some days that nothing triggers your awareness... others where the stresses of the day don't put you in the right mindset to have a uninterrupted dream... and other days when you just can't be bothered.<br><br>
                Like anything else in this world though, you will find that you get out of it about as much as you put into it.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Drugs?</button>
        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                Personally I wouldn't advise the use of drugs in achieving lucid dreaming.<br><br>
                Just to be clear, there are drugs that will definitely help, (galantamine hbr comes to mind*,) but even the ones that do, modify your brain chemistry. Remember that whole conversation about brain chemistry in the dream diary part?<br><br>
                There is a more subtle thing too, when you take the training wheels off a bike... the first thing you need to do is LEARN TO RIDE A BIKE!<br><br>
                *For legal purposes I remind you that in the UK, galantamine hbr is covered by the psychoactive substances bill

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are There Ny Best Practices In Lucid Dreaming</button>
        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                Most of the things that will help you to achieve lucid dreaming in the first place have already been covered in the site. However one thing that I would say can improve your chances is to keep to a regular sleep pattern. If you go to bed at the same time - and also aim to wake up at the same time - every night, you will soon start to know what time you will have a best chance to succeed. Alarm clocks become more useful to you, and you start to become more aware of when you best remember your dreams.<br><br>
                One thing I would always say, is don't try to make lucid dreaming your whole life. Ironically, your best sleep health tends to come off the back of a good waking life. When you are not stressed, and feel mentally satiated, you usually have the best dreams... tiredness and or lethargy don't usually go hand in hand with dreaming.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are there any shortcuts?</button>
        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                Not really! It can be reasonably suggested that you can flood your brain with the notion of lucid dreaming, by devoting your entire day to it... ultimately forcing your brains hand in the theme of the dream. This is not really sustainable though is it? If you have to waste your day to get a little out of the night it seems like a waste to me. I am reminded of that mentality of using a treadmill in a gym... you know those legs could have done the same thing through a park, right?<br><br>
                I think the practice of the day is better served by doing things at the right time, see doors in dreams in the now what section to see what I mean.<br><br>
                If your intention is to only prove it once... maybe I could humour the idea, but again... seems like a waste to me.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">I wake up immediately, Help!</button>
        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                That is not in the slightest bit surprising! I covered that in the what now section as it is always an issue when you start. Your physiology still works the same when you are asleep as when you are awake, thus a shock in a dream is just as likely to wake you as a shock near your sleeping body. What you are doing is the same as a shock, your heart is racing at the 'Woo' moment, and you are taking away your body's expected sleeping physiology.<br><br>
                Just practice, you will get used to it as it will be less and less a shock each time you do it. Better still plan for it, and intentionally count from ten to one before you even consider what you are going to do in the dream.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">If I die in my dreams...</button>
        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                No, you won't die in real life. There are zero consequences from lucid dreaming, (beyond psychological.) I added a what not to do section in the now what section to address those.<br><br>
                You can feel pain.<br>
                You can feel pleasure.<br>
                You can crash head first into a skyscraper if you don't turn fast enough.<br><br>
                I have died many times in my dreams as a simple side effect of taking risks because I know there is no actual consequences. Typically you just either wake up, (if it was a shock,) or transition into another place in the dream.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Are there healing properties to lucid dreaming?</button>
    <div class="expanded_content">
        <p class="question">
            Why would there be? Again we are back into the fantastical stuff that a charlatan can sell you on the back of lucid dreaming... maybe some special tape with the right sounds to direct you into a healing calming dream that will... enough of this stuff... A DREAM IS JUST A DREAM!
        </p>        
    </div>
    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can dreams be used to rehearse a [thing]</button>
    <div class="expanded_content">
        <p class="question">
            Yes, and no. You can always rehearse something in a dream, but remember that a dream and reality are not the same thing. You can only guess what your boss might ask you after that presentation, as too you can only guess there reaction to your pitch.<br><br>
            I personally find that these rehearsals don't pan out for one obvious reason. I want you to imagine right now asking your boss for a raise in your head... did your boss say yes when you asked? NO! He didn't say anything, your imagination answered the question. If you were feeling confident today he probably said yes, if you just had words with him he probably said no, if you are feeling a little stressed he probably fired you for asking.<br><br>
            Then we come on to more technical things. I like to play the piano, but I never do in my sleep... why? Whenever I practice in  my sleep, I never get anything wrong; even if I hit the wrong note, it comes out perfect, at which point I am re-enforcing a mistake.<br><br>
            I guess what I am saying is that in a perfect mind it would work, I personally haven't achieved anything close yet.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">I manage to become lucid but I have no control, what gives?</button>
    <div class="expanded_content">
        <p class="question">
            Lucid dreaming and dream control are not the same thing.<br><br>
            When you first become lucid you might say in your head I want to fly. That doesn't mean you will fly. You need to control your brain by giving it a reason TO fly. Your brain is still conditioned to not being able to fly so you have to overcome that barrier first.<br><br>
            Most of us don't have a particularly great imagination in the day. We can imagine single elements of something at a single time. When we want to go larger we usually have to have some kind of medium to hold our ideas - such as a piece of paper. If you want to do something in lucid dreaming you need to already have a plan. I would read over the what now section to get a better idea of how to plan a dream, its entrance, and its flow... and even some tips on how to enhance the reality of it to you.

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">I struggle to sleep, what can I do?</button>
    <div class="expanded_content">
        <p class="question">
            To begin with I would remind you that lucid dreaming doesn't work at the start of the night anyway. Most people when they say they struggle to sleep usually mean that they struggle to get to sleep; once they are asleep they are there.<br><br>
            That being said, if you are one of those people I would of course suggest staying away from the methodologies that are intended to take you out of and then back into sleep. These methods are to take advantage of what happens when we fall asleep, but if you have the right dream signs they will start to appear anyway.<br><br>
            I could of course recommend all the usual methods of helping someone get to sleep, but I presume that anyone that has these issues is not looking to a lucid dreaming site for such advise.<br><br>

    <button type="button" class="collapsible">Can you confuse a dream for reality?</button>
    <div class="expanded_content">
        <p class="question">
            No. Never.<br>
            I have come across many resources that tell you that you shouldn't do X in a dream because you might confuse it with reality... and that would be REALLLLLLY BAD!<br><br>
            While some dreams might have a quality to them, you are never going to confuse them with reality for two quite simple reasons:
            <ol>
                <li>You chose what the dream would be... it is not like you didn't know you were doing it.</li>
                <li>A lucid dream is never so real as to be confused with reality... while you can do cute things in a lucid dream, it never quite passes for reality.</li>
            </ol>
            The only way you could actually confuse a dream for reality in the light of day, is if you had some underlying medical condition. I have a sneaking suspicion that if that were the case, you wouldn't have any control over your lucid dreams anyway.
