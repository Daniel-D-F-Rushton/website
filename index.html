        Welcome To Lucid Dreaming 101
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <p>
            In this website I will try to teach you the basics of lucid dreaming, in four basic sections:<br><br>
            <li>Diary. In this section you will learn the importance of keeping a dream diary, and how to utilise it to the best effect.</li><br>
            <li>Methods. In this section I will explain the most common, (and effective,) methods for lucid dreaming. When they are most effective, and the best ways to ensure success with them.</li><br>
            <li>What Now? In this section, I will start to discuss the possible uses of lucid dreaming as well as offer some insight into the best practices to get the most of of your lucid dreams. I wouldn't skip this section as being aware, and being in control are two disparate ideas.</li><br>
            <li>Mistakes. A lot of people make very simple mistakes when trying to lucid dream. Some of these are so disruptive that one might lose all faith in succeeding. I this section you will be told the most common mistakes and why they will cause you to fail in your attempts.</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is my belief that everyone should try lucid dreaming at some point. And while there are methods available with such high success rates, it is therefore understood that it is my expectation that everyone should succeed in lucid dreaming too.<br><br>
            Over many years working on artificial intelligence, I have spent a lot of time considering the human mind, its capabilities, and its limits. Through that research, I have come to the understanding that nothing will help you understand the human mind better, than seeing your own mind working for itself, and observing it at work with all the inhibitions and expectations of daily life removed from it.<br><br>
            In expressing this I would hope to portray that there is more on offer behind these proverbial curtains, than just a fun time.
            <br><br>
            Whatever your motivations for trying to lucid dream, I hope that this site will direct you to success in your attempts. Here you will find no clickbait, no gimmicks, and no sale pitch for a retreat in the forrest. This is simply a clear and concise manual to lucid dreaming, with the explanations of why the methods and techniques work expressed at every point. You might not have a lucid dream tonight if you follow these instructions, but you DEFINITELY will have one with continual attempts.<br><br>
