            There are a selection of mistakes in lucid dreaming that are not so much common, as they are ubiquitous. In this section we will go through some of them.

            <p class="question">
                I don't know how many times I have said it on such a small site, but the fact remains it is the most common mistake made in lucid dreaming... trying to have a lucid dream at the wrong time.<br><br>
                The only time you can have a lucid dream is during REM sleep. This will also not be confused with daydreaming that you can do as you are rousing from sleep; the distinction is extraordinary.<br><br>
                MOST people sleep in about ninety minute increments. As the night progresses the proportion of the last part of this ninety minutes, (REM sleep,) increases. Therefore the best time to try and have a lucid dream is just before you were going to wake up.<br><br>
                I have said it before and I shall say it again, there is a zero percent chance of a lucid dream at the start of the night!

        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                If you make a check for lucidity, and it doesn't pertain to your own dreams it will be useless. There are a few base checks out there which seem to be ubiquitous but they are only a guide. Your own checks should relate to your own dreams...<br><br>
                For the sake of being random... if you have a tickle me Elmo on your shelf, and you are seeing tickle me Elmo in your sleep, take its batteries out and tickle it... that way if it laughs when you tickle it you know you must be dreaming. Let's see you find that reality check on another site!

        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                One of the most common mistakes is when a lucidity check is made with the intention of proving you are awake... If X doesn't happen then I know I must be awake.<br><br>
                If you do this you miss the point. The point is to be absolutely sure that you are dreaming! If you perform your check at night, all you are going to do is convince yourself that you are in fact awake, and that there is no point to having fun with this dream.<br><br>
                As a general point I would advise only ever performing a lucidity check that not only proves you are asleep, but triggers a natural action in the dream when it works. The door example where you imagine what is on the other side is a good one as it gives you a gateway to your planned dream. Others such as testing the lights going on and off, offer the same effect that you could find yourself in the place you want to be.

            <p class="question">
                We have spoken many a time about brain chemistry. When you find yourself aware that you are dreaming, you are not going to have the normal brain chemistry in your head. Therefore if you have to imagine on the spot, it is going to be as random as a normal dream. By having a plan - a script if you will - you will not find yourself in that job interview trying to answer a simple question you have not planned for... yes you know the answer usually, but at this point in time it is the last thing that you can bring to the front of your mind.

            <p class="question">
                There is an automatic presumption that because you wake up when you are excited, that you should try and minimize everything in the dream. The reason you wake up from shock like that is because you become aware of something in your actual physical body. When something happens to your dream body, usually that is not the case. You can be excited and do fun things in the dream body all you want.<br><br>
                To the contrary of that mistake, you will find that if you are falling out of a dream and back into the waking, one of the easiest things you can do to stay in the dream is to become more aware of the dream body... move around, touch things, pay attention to them.

        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                It is very unlikely you are going to have any success in lucid dreaming if you do not keep a dream diary. I know for some it might seem a little strange to keep a diary, as you are the kind of person that doesn't keep diaries, but I assure you... it is imperative to the task.<br><br>
                It is also true to say that you are going to have to keep up the practice if you want to keep having lucid dreams. So you become good at lucid dreaming and it crosses your mind that you don't need the diary any more... all that happens is you become less and less invested, (as far as your subconscious is concerned,) and your brain starts to separate day and night again.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible">Trying Too Hard</button>
        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                I know you really want to get results fast, but if you spend all night just trying to do this one thing, you are going to start losing sleep... then you are going to feel worse in the day... then you will fell less like trying in the night... which means you will fail... which means you will start losing hope... and stop caring... you get the point.<br><br>
                Whilst it is true that you get out of it what you put into it, there is most definitely a point of diminishing returns. Try relaxing a bit, and see if you can incorporate your intentions in a more fun manner. If it feels like a chore, you are probably trying too hard.

            <p class="question">
                AKA: ooh, a sweetie.<br><br>
                If you want to have fun the chances are that you are going to lose awareness. It is the same in real life that time passes quickly, (in the perception of the human mind at least,) when we are having fun. This is because we are less aware of the world around us in our mania... the same is true when you are dreaming.<br><br>
                Now there is a certain give and take here. You can direct a dream using lucidity then enjoy where the dream goes, but the second you do that, it is no longer in your control. Owing to human nature it is all to common for someone to think, "I want to have sex," and then get lost in whatever happens next.<br><br>
                There is a certain skill to being able to design a dream that keeps reminding you that you are dreaming, but it can be done. To begin with you should probably just keep trying to perform a lucidity check every so often. One method I like to use however is to have a tune playing in my head as a background, which has built into it a lucidity reminder.

        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                On day 1, you will be able to do nothing but wake up.<br>
                On day 2, you will be able to stay asleep.<br>
                On day 3, you will try and fly, only to realise that gravity is preventing you.<br>
                On day 4, you will remember that you have wings, and crash into the ceiling.<br>
                On day 5, you will go outside and try, but have no idea where you are going.<br>
                On day 6, you will will fly to where you intended to go to find it empty.<br>               
                By about day 30, you might realise you don't need to fly to get there.<br>
                By about day 100, you might realise you could have just started there<br><br>
                Look, I am not suggesting that it is going to take you that long to be able to control your dreams, but you are going to try and run before you can walk. As we have discussed, awareness, and control are two very different things. You are going to have to take things step by step, the faster you try to go, the slower the progress is going to be.

        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                The first place most people's minds go when they think about lucid dreaming is sex. This is unfortunately also true when they become aware they are dreaming. They become excited and it becomes a sensory overload... and they haven't even got to the sex yet.<br><br>
                There is also another bizarre nuance that is hard to explain to a non-initiate. Your sub-conscious brain is not as interested in sex as your conscious mind is. Most attempts to have sex in a lucid dream fall apart much faster than you can create them.<br><br>
                Just to be clear, I am not saying that sex is off the menu, but until you are somewhat adept at dream control you shouldn't make it your primary goal.

        <div class="expanded_content">
            <p class="question">
                This one really harkens back to dream design. If you don't design your dreams you are going to find that in the spur of the moment, your imagination isn't that impressive. As a result of this, a lot of people find themselves having the same four dreams over and over again, getting bored by them.<br><br>
                There are a lot of things you can do in a lucid dream, but don't rely on your brain to figure it out at the last second. It is your waking brain you want to have the experience with, so let your waking brain have the idea in the day.
