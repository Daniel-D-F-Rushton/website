        <h2 id="sub_headings">Senses Make It Better</h2>
        <p>
            So you have managed to lucid dream a few times and you want to go further. Let's start with how to make it better.<br><br>
            The first thing you might want to consider is that you have five senses, and you will want to use all of them. This is not just a quality issue, this is a movement issue. I consider movement in dreams to be anything that either takes you from one place to another, or changes one thing into another.<br><br>
            How well can you imagine fish and chips? Do you think you can conjure them out of thin air by sight. Perhaps you might have the sense to try and smell them first... at that point there is no doubt, there is a chip shop down this road isn't there... we can get our fish and chips from there... no doubt when we leave the shop we will be at the seaside too.<br><br>
            The five senses increase the quality of the dream, they can be used as a movement device, but they are also imperative in ensuring that you don't wake up. At any point where you are rousing you can hold on to a strong element of the dream to make your dream last that little bit longer. Sometimes it is the smell of the food, sometimes it is the sound of the waterfall, but your immersion in the dream is usually the thing that will stop you waking up prematurely.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sub_headings">Plan In Advance</h2>
        <p>
            I am sure you have heard it many times by now, but planning is the key to success. There are two basics ways that you can plan, the first is to plan out what will be in the dream, and the second is to plan out how you will get there.<br><br>
            I have harkened back to the door reality check many a time, and that is because it is a find example of the second. A reality check that not only proves that you are dreaming, but also transports you into the dream you have designed before hand.<br><br>
            As far as the plan goes, make it as visceral as possible. Plan the where, the who, the what. Decide how you are going to move from one place to another. What will the weather be? What will you be able to hear, smell, taste, touch, see. What will you be wearing? Will you be hungry... yes, you can plan that kind of thing too.<br><br>
            If you are not very good at imagining your own plans, there is nothing to stop you plagiarizing someone elses work. You can follow Alice down the rabbit hole if you really want to... you can play quidditch on the field that was already designed for you in a movie. You can go to places you have already been. You can see people you have already met. The most important thing - by far - is knowing what you are going to do in advance. As I have said before, once you get there and have nothing planned - your mind will go blank.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sub_headings">Keep Improving Those Signs</h2>
        <p>
            If you want to have more lucid dreams, you are going to have to have more successful reality checks. It is easier to do this with more signs.<br><br>
            As you get these signs you should try to design a custom test for those signs. I personally try to match a single plan to a single sign and then essentially let the sign decide which of the plans I perform that night.<br><br>
            You should also become more aware of what signs can be as you progress too. At first you will be looking for mirrors, and light switches... but after a while you will notice it can be a noise, or a feeling, or a person, etc. If it is a common theme in your dreams, you should be able to make a sign out of it.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sub_headings">What Not To Do</h2>
        <p>
            To begin with, let's come to the understanding that there is nothing you can't do in lucid dreaming.<br><br>
            Without going full cliche on it, there comes with it responsibility. As a general rule I would suggest not doing anything that you morally wouldn't do in the daytime.<br><br>
            We should be clear here, there are no literal consequences for anything that you do in a dream, but there could be psychological ones. The dream police aren't going to come and batter down your door, but you should probably take a little time to consider how it might affect your mentality in real life.<br><br>
            So you are attracted to that person, and you decide to have a relationship with them in your dream... you realise that you are only actually interacting with your presumptions of what that person is right? Then the question comes, what happens when you interact with that person in the daytime... do you think they will interact with you the same way?<br><br>
            Don't eat babies I guess? I don't imagine that this is going to propagate into your waking life, but probably best not to test it.<br><br>
            Other than that it is just common sense stuff... if you are going to fly - make a good habit of taking off from the ground. Many a person has gone off the top of a block of flats in a drug induced haze because they thought they would test their wings up high first.
