        <h2 id="sub_headings">Why Start With A Dairy?</h2>
        <p>
            If you have done any research at all before hitting upon this site, I can guarantee that you have come across the notion of a dream diary. This is not surprising as it is without a doubt the most important tool that you will learn. Unfortunately when this is taught to beginners, it is usually expressed in terms of how it might be used in the long term, but for the sake of any beginners that might be here... you need it now... today!<br><br>
            For the observant among you, you will have noticed that this is the second page in the site, before even techniques. This is because if you don't have a dream diary, you are all but guaranteed to fail.<br><br>
            The reason why is that everyone dreams. Although people might tell you that they don't remember their dreams, they most definitely do have them; the REM sleep required to have them is fundamental to sanity, and thus anyone that is sane enough to suggest they don't clearly does. The intention here is not to tell people they are wrong, but rather to tell them why they are wrong. There is a reason you don't remember your dreams! <br><br>
            There is an almost universal experience I can draw you to. I want you to think back now to a time you were having some fun with your mates, someone says something funny and you all roll over laughing. Then the next day came around and try as you might, you can't remember the thing you were laughing about. A few weeks then pass, and you are with your mates again laughing about something else, and blam... you can suddenly all remember the joke again.<br><br>
            So why does this happen? It is actually quite obvious from the point of view of chemistry and biology. When you create a new memory in your brain, there are neurons that connect together as they were used together for the first time. As you use them together more and more they get a stronger and stronger link. Eventually when you think of one, you automatically think of the other and we have associative memory. <br><br>
            On the other hand there are memories that only happen once, so the association still has to be made in the same way, but they aren't as strongly linked as they aren't used as often together. In these instances the chemistry of your brain at the time acts as an accelerant to their connection. These two neurons will cause each other to fire <strong>if and only if</strong> the chemical makeup of the brain was the same as when they were first linked.<br><br>
            Now let's think back. The first time we were with our mates already having a laugh and we had all the happy time chemicals in our brain. The second time we were trying to remember it and the chemicals required to fire this new memory weren't there. The third time, we were having a laugh with our mates again, the chemistry was the same as the first time, and what do you know?... we can link the two neurons with ease.<br><br>
            This exact same process happens when you wake up. You go from sleep chemistry to awake chemistry, and all the things you would remember from sleep you can't because the ability to get the neurons to fire is no longer there.<br><br>
            The problem comes in the understanding that most of use either rouse from sleep slowly, (writhing under the covers praying to Oneiros for a couple more minutes,) making our brain chemistry far from sleep by the time we get to conscious thought. Or, we get jolted out of our bed by an alarm we jump up and completely separate our days from our nights.<br><br>
            Don't worry though, this is where a cool thing happens. If you train yourself to get up at just the right time - by a slightly less offensive alarm method for example. You can lie still and remember your dreams for a few minutes. As you start to do this, you start to cross over the brain chemistries and let the neurons fire in the relative neutrality of the day time.<br><br>
            The more you do this, the further back into your dreams you will start to remember. The more often you do this, the more the brain will start to link access to the dream chemistry to the neutral chemistry.<br><br>
            So this is the immediate importance of the dream journal, it is to link the day to the night, the waking to the sleeping. It will of course by habit also tell your subconscious brain that your conscious brain considers the dreams to be important, and thus should stop disregarding them at the moment of waking.

        <h2 id="sub_headings">Longer Term Use</h2>
        <p>     
            Now that we know the immediate importance of a dream journal, let's take a look at the longer term use of a dream journal.<br><br>
            As you use a dream journal more and more, you will start to generate more and more information each morning. The number of dreams you will remember will increase, and the length of the dreams remember will also increase. With this will come themes and patterns in your dreams that you didn't realise existed before... because you didn't realise you dreamed so much.<br><br>
            Some of these will be activities, often times you will find yourself in particular places, you might interact with certain objects, and you might talk to specific people on a frequency that is useful to take advantage of. If you know what these are, you will be able to use them to customize your lucidity techniques to get the best results for yourself. If for example your are always finding yourself walking through doors in your dreams, you might be able to make a lucidity test that you practice in the day specifically to increase your chances of becoming lucid when you are dreaming.<br><br>
            This is the most important use of a dream diary after you have started to have lucid dreams with more frequency - and with it should come an understanding. Lucid dreaming is a practiced skill... if you do it more and more you will get better and better at it. If you do it less and less, it will happen less frequently. It is not a case of, "Well I know how to lucid dream now," I can stop using the dream diary now. The use of your dream journal is directly proportional to the amount of lucid dreams you will have.<br><br>
            Now that you understand the importance of a dream journal, grab that pen and paper, and take a look at some of the techniques for training lucidity.
