        Best Methods And Practices For Lucid Dreaming
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2 id="sub_headings">Let's Start With The Diary</h2>
        <p>
            Keep a dream diary, add to it every morning, try to remember your dreams.<br><br>
            As understated as that first instruction might be, it is the main one. I honestly believe that if you were to just do that one thing, that you would eventually have a lucid dream by the nature of familiarity.<br><br>
            So let's start with a couple of notes of what should be in your dream diary. There is actually a lot of things that you can add to your dream diary, but I would say to begin with, stick to only dreams. What I mean by that is a lot of people like to conflate a dream diary with a waking journal, the results of which just tend to cause superstition. You had a chicken pizza for tea last night and you happen to remember a little more in your dream tonight... I guess it was the pizza right?<br><br>
            We start with a location, where did it take place, have we been there before?<br>
            Who was there, did we know them?<br>
            What was I doing?<br>
            Did I move from any place to another?<br>
            Was there particular items involved?<br>
            Did we notice the weather?<br>
            Was there any emotion involved?<br>
            Did anything out of place happen?<br>
            Was it one continuous dream, or was there a gap in the middle.<br>
            Can we remember how we got here?<br>
            Can we remember when the [item] appeared?<br>
            Do we know how [person] got there<br>
            Did the voices of the people match them, did they say what you would expect them to say?<br>
            Can you remember anything on the periphery of the dream?<br>
            Does the content of the dream relate to something that was in your recent past<br><br>
            As you can see, there is a lot of things that you can add... just write everything. I tend to find that when I wake up I can fill an A5 piece of paper. And when I read that piece of paper, I can flesh it out into five or six times more information as I remember by reading it.<br><br>
            When you create your dream journal, you should try to keep in mind that you never know what you are going to dream tomorrow. You might think to yourself, "This isn't that important." You need to avoid this mentality as much as possible as you won't realise that there are commonalities in your dreams at a later point, if you only recorded it every so often.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sub_headings">Lucidity Checks</h2>
        <p>
            Nothing in the dream emulates the day. I say this to expel a notion that is usually told to people that the point of lucidity checks is to make your brain do something at night that it wouldn't usually do.<br><br>
            When you go to bead, your brain takes fragments of the day - rogue thoughts if you will - and bombards them with chemicals. Your internal theatre is then there for the ride, and you along with it. This is a dream, and yes it is that random.<br><br>
            When you look in a mirror it is never right in a dream... SO WHAT? I never see mirrors in my dreams<br><br>
            Your finger will go through your palm... Never in 25 years of lucid dreaming has my finger EVER spontaneously tried to go through my palm.<br><br>
            There will be more than five fingers on your hand... Nope! Five - every single time!!!<br><br>
            With this understanding comes a little dose of reality, lucidity checks to begin with are kind of worthless. You really need it to be linked to something that was <strong>going to happen in the night anyway</strong> to make it effective. It is true that you could bombard your brain with checks all day long, but really... who has time for that?<br><br>
            That now hopefully being understood... this is how you are supposed to be using a reality check.<br><br>
            <li>Record something in your diary consistently. This could be for example going through a door.</li><br>
            <li>Create a lucidity check of your own devising to use every time you - in our example - go through a door. Whenever I open a door, I am first going to imagine what is going to be on the other side - let's say the Great Pyramids, and if they are there I know I will be in a dream</li><br>
            <li>Perform the test every time you do through a door.</li><br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I like this example as it allows us to explain the way to use this check. When you go through the door, you have to convince yourself that the Great Pyramids <strong>ARE</strong> going to be on the other side! Try and imagine them on the other side of the door, and see if it matches with what you expected. The goal is not to say, "Well they aren't there so I am not dreaming." The goal is to both prove that you <strong>ARE</strong> dreaming, and to have this convenient gateway to the Great Pyramids, that you wanted to go to.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sub_headings">WBTB - Wake Back To Bed</h2>
        <p>
            I want to cover this method first as it is both the most effective and allows me to explain a massive mistake that most people make when coming across these methods.<br><br>
            You can only lucid dream when you are dreaming. You can only dream, (in any meaningful manner,) when you are in REM sleep. If you try any method when you are not about to be in REM sleep it will not work... seriously - zero percent success rate!<br><br>
            Remember back when we were talking about dream diaries and how we mix the chemistry of the day with the chemistry of the night. This method takes advantage of that in almost the opposite way. We utilise the chemistry of the day, to keep awareness more keenly once we start sleeping.
            This is the method:
            <li>Set your alarm clock for when you are going to be in REM sleep - usually five and a half hours after sleep is a good estimation.</li><br>
            <li>Wake up, go do something. You can do anything you want really, the whole point is just to make your aware of being awake. The only thing to avoid is harsh light such as going outside in the daylight, or looking at a computer screen. [This light causes melatonin to build up which will prevent you falling back to sleep]</li><br>
            <li>Go back to sleep, trying to keep your conscious attention on something. This will hlp you become aware of when you are falling asleep.</li><br> 
        </p>
        <p>
            That is basically the entire technique. Some people find that how they maintain their awareness help them such as a sensation in their body. Some people like to say a mantra in their heads. If you get it right, it will be like all those times you realised you were dreaming, then woke up trying not to... just in reverse.<br><br>
            You might have also heard about WILD - IT IS THE SAME THING!!! Hence omitted here as a separate thing - As the only time you can perform this is when you are about to enter REM. Imagine going through all the awareness just to not be in the right stage of sleep... this is why I scoff at people who claim to be able to lucid dream the second their head hits the pillow.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sub_headings">MILD Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dream</h2>
        <p>
            MILD is based on prospective memory. That is to say that your brain is good at remembering that is was expecting to do something.<br><br>
            Do you ever find yourself looking at the clock repeatedly in the night when you have an appointment in the morning? Of course you have, you do it every night... you just only notice that you are doing it when you have something to associate to the clock.<br><br>
            But that conscious awareness of the appointment is important. While you might not be doing anything you wouldn't do on a normal night, the fact that you brain recurs the thought can be taken advantage of. If instead of realising every time that you look at the clock that you need to be somewhere in four hour and seven minutes, you were instead reminding yourself that you want to be aware of your dream, you start to enter into the territory of the WBTB mentality. Each time that you doze back off, you give yourself yet another chance of questioning reality in your sleep.<br><br>
            The best results of MILD are based around the following steps:
            <li>Try to remember your most recent dream as you are falling asleep.</li><br>
            <li>Draw your attention to something that was a little off in the dream that should have made you aware that you were dreaming</li><br>
            <li>Repeat to yourself - it doesn't have to be in words, but it can help - the understanding that when you see [anomaly] you will remember you are dreaming</li>
        </p>
        <p>
            Lather, rinse, repeat.<br><br>
            As we have already discussed, this will really do nothing at the start of the night, but you can at least build the habit at the start of the night, so that you might do it again at a time in the night when it has a chance of working.
        </p>
        <h2 id="sub_headings">That Is It!</h2>
        <p>
            There is nothing more to day as far as methods go. There are a million methods out there beyond this - and usually some crude variation on these - and they are all designed to sell books, videos, retreats, and magical do-hickeys.<br><br>
            The facts remain the same however, these are the only things you need to know to lucid dream. You might find that once you get better at lucid dreaming you have your own special routine that works for you, but for the most part it will work ONLY for you... that kind of proves that any variation, you will have to find for yourself.<br><br>
            Good luck!
